The Atlas of Baseline Risk Assessment for Infectious Disease (ABRAID) is an automated mapping platform (MP). The essence of the project is to create a system that automatically generates spatially comprehensive, iteratively improving, evidence-based maps of disease risk at the global scale. They will be continuously updated in response to new occurrence data collection. The concept is outlined in more detail in Hay et al. (2013).

        <strong>Important:</strong>
        This is a prototype platform and the maps displayed are still being validated.
        This map shows the probability of occurrence of the disease named, based on environmental factors.
        It is not a map of disease prevalence, i.e. the proportion of people at a location infected,
        and it is not a map of disease incidence, i.e. the number of people who become sick.
        It is also important to note that the current platform does not yet use intervention data
        (e.g. vaccine coverage) to refine the spatial disease distributions shown on the map.

            <strong>Important:</strong>
            This is a prototype platform and the maps displayed are still being validated.
            This map shows the probability of occurrence of the disease based on environmental factors.<br>
            It is not a map of disease prevalence, i.e the proportion of people at a location infected,
            and it is not a map of disease incidence, i.e. the number of people who become sick.<br>
            It is also important to note that the current platform does not yet use intervention data
            (e.g. vaccine coverage) to refine the spatial disease distributions shown in the map.

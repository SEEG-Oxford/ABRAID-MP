<p>The Data Validator allows disease experts* to contribute to two components of the ABRAID platform. Experts can
    validate new disease occurrence data coming in to the platform, and provide an expert opinion on the geographical extent
    of a disease at a national/state level. Both contributions will feed into our mapping process and help ensure the final
    outputs are valid.</p>

<p>* As a disease expert you are either an expert on a particular disease or disease class, or an expert on the range of
    diseases found within a particular geographical region, or a combination of both. All expertise in these fields is
    useful, and you are not expected to validate or comment on areas outside your field of expertise.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 5px">Validating new disease occurrence data points</h5>
<p>The Data Validator only displays points that our system has identified as questionable. The data displayed does not
    represent the data that goes into our models. These are points that may be incorrectly reported or they may be the
    result of disease spread.</p>
<p>Once you have selected <i>disease occurrences</i> and the disease of your choice using the dropdown boxes in the top
    left of the screen, you will see a map with purple dots marking any new occurrence data that is waiting to be validated.
    New data will be displayed for one week.</p>
<p>When you click on one of the dots on the map, information about that data point will appear in the panel on the right.
    You can also click the links to see the original report (if the original report is still available online) and/or to
    translate the summary text from this report.</p>
<p>When you click on the dot on the map, a short description of the location will also appear on the map. The dot on the
    map may represent a precise location such as a town, or a wider area such as a district or state. This will be
    specified in the text description for each dot on the map.</p>
<p><strong><i>We are asking you to validate whether, in your expert opinion, the named disease is a current** infection
    risk at the place specified.</i></strong></p>

<p>You can do this solely based on your expert knowledge or with reference to the report information in the right-hand
    side panel. Three buttons are provided in the right-hand panel - <i>valid</i>, <i>unsure</i>, <i>invalid</i> - and the
    fourth option is to ignore a data point altogether if it is outside your area of expertise. Click <i>valid</i> if, in
    your expert opinion, the named disease currently** occurs at the place specified, <i>invalid</i> if your opinion is that
    it does not, and <i>unsure</i> if there is uncertainty in the occurrence of this disease at this place. Once you have
    validated a point, it will disappear from the map.</p>

<p>** By "currently" we mean that the disease is extant at the location, i.e. it has not been eliminated, even if there
    are seasons when new cases are not seen.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 5px">Providing an expert opinion on the geographical extent of a disease</h5>
<p>Once you have selected <i>disease extent</i> and the disease of your choice using the dropdown boxes in the top left
    of the screen, you will see a map showing all regions of the world, each with a disease classification.</p>

<p>Very large countries have been divided into States and all other countries are shown as single nations. The map
    displayed does not show the smallest islands and enclaves, which are outside the scope of our global models. To
    accurately reflect the disease extent, non-contiguous parts of a country are shown separately, for example Easter Island
    is separate from Chile and Alaska is separate from the USA.</p>
<p>To select an area, either click on the map or click on the name in the table in the right-hand panel. The map will
    then zoom to the relevant area and the place name will be highlighted in the table. In addition, a pop-up box will
    display the most recent disease occurrence points for that area if there are any.</p>
<p><strong><i>We are asking you to provide your expert opinion on whether the disease is present or possibly present or
    possibly absent or absent, or whether there is uncertainty on disease presence, for each area of the map.</i></strong>
    Alternatively you can select <i>Don't know</i> if it is outside your area of expertise.</p>
<p>The map that is currently displayed has been informed by 1) incoming data points that have been validated and 2)
    expert opinions that have been provided previously. Your opinion will feed into the class assigned to the next map
    produced after one week.</p>
